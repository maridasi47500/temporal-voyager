# ChronoCode Editor – Fictional Era Coding Simulator
🖥️ Core Features
🕰️ Era Selector: Choose your coding era—Victorian, Cyberpunk, Post-AI Renaissance, etc.

🧬 Language Skin: Syntax highlighting mimics fictional languages (e.g., “SteamScript” or “NeuroRuby”).

📜 Retro/Future UI Themes: Toggle between parchment scrolls or holographic terminals.

🧠 Auto-Commentary: Generates era-appropriate comments like:

ruby
# Invented during the Great Algorithmic Rebellion of 2097
🛠️ How It Could Work
Frontend: Use CodeMirror or Monaco Editor for the base editor.

Customization: Add fictional syntax rules, fonts, and sound effects (e.g., typewriter clicks or plasma pulses).

Offline Mode: No real-time saving—just snapshots like journal entries from a time traveler.
